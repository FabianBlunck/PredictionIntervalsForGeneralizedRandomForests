# Replication material for the master thesis "Prediction Intervals For Generalized Random Forests" by Fabian Blunck

This repository contains code for the replication of the results and figures in Chapter 9 "Simulation Study" and Chapter 10 "Empirical Study" of the master thesis "Prediction Intervals For Generalized Random Forests" by Fabian Blunck. To replicate the results, download all files into the same folder, install the required R packages, and change the manual settings, like working directory, at the top of the "SimulationStudy.R" and "EmpiricalStudy.R" files.

The code was written and tested in R version 4.2.1 - "Funny-Looking Kid".
